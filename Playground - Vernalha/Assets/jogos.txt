There’s nothing wrong with playing hundreds of hours of Civilization; there is something wrong if you are forgetting the rest of your life in the process.
That escape from reality is a serious part of addiction, and is not limited to video games.

Video games by their very design are meant to be addicting and engaging activities, and there’s nothing wrong with that.

However, when you have video games that explicitly target people who are susceptible to addictive behavior and build your game around that, then that’s going too far. Monetization elements, no matter what people say, do not benefit the consumer; especially if they are being scaled against them such as with gachas.

If your game is good enough, then people will come back to keep playing them; trying to trick them to spend more money is when things go too far.

the difference between a video game being engaging, and when that engagement can become bad.
